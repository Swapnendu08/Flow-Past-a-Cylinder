# Flow-Past-a-Cylinder
It is a Time Dependent CFD project of determining the arrangement of fluid flow across a cylinder using COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS simulation Software which solves the Governing partial differential equation and gives
us the results like Velocity and Contour Profile, Pressure Profile, Lift and Drag Coefficient plots etc.

The flow of fluid behind a blunt body such as an automobile is difficult to compute dueto the unsteady flows. The wake behind such a body consists of unordered eddies of all 
sizes that create large drag on the body. In contrast, the turbulence in the thin boundarylayers next to the streamlined bodies of aircraft and fish create only weak disturbances of
flow. An exception to this occurs when you place a slender body at right angles to a slow flow because the eddies organize. A von Ka´rma´n vortex street appears with a predictable
frequency and involves the shedding of eddies from alternating sides. Everyday examples of this phenomenon include singing telephone wires and an automobile radio antenna
vibrating in an air stream.
